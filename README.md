# hello-world
My first repository

Hi, people.

I'm Max. I'm 25. I live in Russia, have three cats, three guitars and a girlfriend)) 
This case in new for me, but I really want to learn how to program and think like a true programmer. I want to improve my skills, my life and the life of the world around me. I am sure that GitHub and this wonderful community will help me with this)
